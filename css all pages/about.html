        <h1 style="font-size: xx-large; text-align: center;">About Us</h1>
        <p style="display: inline-block; text-align: center; font-size: x-large;">As a student at Hajiyani Sakeena IT Institute, I am immersed in a 
            comprehensive web and app development course. This dynamic program 
            equips me with essential skills to create cutting-edge websites 
            and mobile applications. The curriculum covers a range of topics, 
            including front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as 
            well as back-end development using languages such as Python or Java. 
            Practical hands-on projects and real-world scenarios enhance my 
            learning experience, fostering a deep understanding of the development 
            lifecycle. With the support of experienced instructors at Hajiyani 
            Sakeena IT Institute, I am poised to excel in the rapidly evolving 
            field of web and app development, preparing for a successful career 
            in the tech industry.</p>
